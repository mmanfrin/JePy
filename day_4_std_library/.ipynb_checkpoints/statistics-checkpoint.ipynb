    "One of the most basic properties of a data set is it's mean. Mean is a measure of the **_Central Tendency_** of data. In layman terms, if you were to pick one point in a dataset that is representative of the entire dataset, it would be the mean. Also called \"average\" in common vocabulary, calculating the mean is really simple. Just add up all the values in a particular variable of a dataset and divide it by the total number of values in it. \n",
